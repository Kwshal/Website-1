repetition can be avoid when declaring properties in javascript using Object.assign instead:
       
       
     Example:
       Object.assign(burgerMenu.style, {
          display: "flex",
          transition: "height 0.9s ease, width 0.9s ease",
          height: "100vh",
          width: "clamp(300px, 40vw, 350px)",
        });

# it's ideal to use max-height or max-width instead of height and width for responsive design.
